## Backend

-   `Neon` (PostgreSQL â€“ NoSQL) cloud DB used for scalability
-   `Prisma` (Object Relational Model) to talk to DB
-   Using `Clerk` for authentication

-   We created a folder in root called `/lib` that contains `db.ts`
    -   this file is used to connect to the db (if it's not already connected)

### Adding Clerk Authentication

-   easily add authentication to application (github, google, etc)

### OpenRouter

-   installed openai npm package and used openrouter platform to make ai suggestions to choose category of expense added (used the deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free to make free api calls)

### Charts

-   used the chart.js and react-chartjs-2 (bar) library
