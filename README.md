## Backend

- `Neon` (PostgreSQL â€“ NoSQL) cloud DB used for scalability
- `Prisma` (Object Relational Model) to talk to DB
- Using `Clerk` for authentication

- We created a folder in root called `/lib` that contains `db.ts`
    - this file is used to connect to the db (if it's not already connected)

### Adding Clerk Authentication

- easily add authentication to application (github, google, etc)
